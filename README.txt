<<Final project specification>>

I took the completed adventure game from assignment 4, and added a new feature that allows the user to add the enemies as new companions in the party. And then the user can sell them in the end of the game for money.

1. Object-oriented design principles
 - A player can put enemies in the Item list as a companion. (Enemy class implements Item class) 
 - More enemies and behaviors.f

2. Interactive
 - The program asks whether the user wants to let enemies join the party or not.

3. Data persistence
 - Save game feature. The player can save and restart if the same name is typed.
